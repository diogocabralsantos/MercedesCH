Feature: Mercedes-Benz Shop interaction

Scenario: Filter cars and submit invalid contact details
  Given I open the Mercedes-Benz Shop used cars in Australia
    And I fill in the location details with:
      | State       | New South Wales |
      | Postal Code | 2007            |
      | Purpose     | Private         |
  When I click the filter button
    And I apply the following filters:
      | Color  | Red |
  Then I sort by the most expensive cars first
      | Sorting | Price: High to Low |
  When I navigate to Vehicle Details page
  Then I can save the following vehicle details to a file
      #| Model Year    | 2018      |
      #| VIN Number    | 12345790  |
  When I click enquire now
    And I fill the contact details and Account creation form with invalid data
      | First Name     | John          |
      | Last Name     | Doe            |
      | Postcode      |2000            |
      | Mobile Number | +61412345678   |
      | E-mail        | 123@123        |

  Then I canÂ´t proceed because one or more details are incorrect
